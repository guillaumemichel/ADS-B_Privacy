# Aircraft privacy

FAA addresses [ADS-B Privacy](https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/equipadsb/privacy/) issues by implementing a new privacy program allowing aircraft to change ICAO number and Callsign to mitigate tracking with ADS-B.

## ICAO privacy

FAA can issue Privacy ICAO Address ([PIA](https://nbaa.org/aircraft-operations/security/privacy/privacy-icao-address-pia/)) that can currently be updated every 60 calendar days (phase 1), and can later be updated every 20 buisiness days (phase 2). The PIA program enables interested aircraft owners to request an alternate, temporary ICAO Address, which will not be assigned to the owner in the [Civil Aviation Registry](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/) (CAR).

It is clearly not enough to provide anonymity to aircrafts.

## Callsign privacy

Currently 2 operators are able to provide private: [fltplan.com](https://flttrack.fltplan.com/FltPlanInfo/DCMCallSigns.htm) (DCM####) and [foreflight.com](https://foreflight.com/support/support-center/category/about-foreflight-mobile/360040732274) (FFL###) and (DAL####) Delta Airlines??????. Those operators are able to change their users callsign for every flight. The owners have to file their flights on the website to have a *random* callsign allocation.

## Problems

For now, only a few aircrafts are enrolled in this program, thus it is easy to track them by checking the origin and destination airport. Furthermore, the ICAO number only changes at most approximatively every 20 days.

##Â TODO

remove spaces in callsign (and nnumber?) in json files
